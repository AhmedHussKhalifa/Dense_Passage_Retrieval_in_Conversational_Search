The code is splitted between 2 different plateforms, which are Google Collab and Compute Canada. It also contains 2 other repos that are used in the implenetation of this project, DPR repo for "Dense Passage Retrieval" and CAsT Dataset


## Features
1. BASH files to submit Jobs on different clusters on CoputeCanada.
2. NoteBooks to used on Google Collabs. 
3. Dense retriever model is based on bi-encoder architecture.
4. Dense Passage Retrieval  inspired by [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906) paper.
5. Related data pre- and post- processing tools.
