The code is splitted between 2 different plateforms, which are Google Collab and Compute Canada. It also contains 2 other repos that are used in the implenetation of this project, DPR repo for "Dense Passage Retrieval" and CAsT Dataset


## Features
1. Dense retriever model is based on bi-encoder architecture.
2. Extractive Q&A reader&ranker joint model inspired by [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03868) paper.
3. Related data pre- and post- processing tools.
4. Dense retriever component for inference time logic is based on FAISS index.
